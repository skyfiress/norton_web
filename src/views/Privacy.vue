            <li><h3><span>What data do we process? </span></h3></li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>We process various categories of data about you. The main categories of data are the following:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Technical data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>When you use our website or other online offerings, we collect the IP address of your terminal device and other technical data in order to ensure the functionality and security of these offerings. This data includes logs with records of the use of our systems. We generally keep technical data for 1 month. In order to ensure the functionality of these offerings, we may also assign an individual code to you or your terminal device (for example as a cookie, see Section 12). Technical data as such does not permit us to draw conclusions about your identity. However, technical data may be linked with other categories of data (and potentially with your person) in relation to user accounts, registrations, access controls or the performance of a contract.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Registration data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Certain offerings, for example competitions, and services (such as login areas of our website, newsletters, etc.) can only be used with a user account or registration,
            which can happen directly with us or through our third-party login service providers. In this regard you must provide us with certain data, and we collect data about
            the use of the offering or service. If you redeem a voucher issued by us, we may require certain data from you at the time of redemption. If we issue a voucher to you
            for one of our contractual partners, we may share or receive some of your registration data from the relevant contractual partner (see Section 7). Registration data may
            be required in relation to access control to certain facilities, potentially including biometric data, depending on the control system. We generally keep registration
            data for 12 months from the date the use of the service ceases or the user account is closed.</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Communication data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you are in contact with us via the contact form, by e-mail, telephone or chat, or by letter or other means of communication, we collect the data exchanged between
            you and us, including your contact details and the metadata of the communication. If we have to determine your identity, for example in relation to a request for
            information, a request for press access, etc., we collect data to identify you (for example a copy of an ID document). We generally keep this data for 12 months from
            the last exchange between us. This period may be longer where required for evidentiary purposes, to comply with legal or contractual requirements, or for technical
            reasons. E-mails in personal mailboxes and written correspondence are generally kept for at least 10 years. Cats are generally stored for 2 years.</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Master data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>With master data we mean the basic data that we need, in addition to contract data (see below), for the performance of our contractual and other business relationships
            or for marketing and promotional purposes, such as name and contact details, and information about, for example, your role and function, your bank details, your date of
            birth, customer history, powers of attorney, signature authorizations and declarations of consent. We process your master data if you are a customer or other business
            contact or work for one (for example as a contact person of the business partner), or because we wish to address you for our own purposes or for the purposes of a
            contractual partner (for example as part of marketing and advertising, with invitations to events, with vouchers, with newsletters, etc.). We receive master data from
            you (for example when you make a purchase or as part of a registration), from parties you work for, or from third parties such as contractual partners, associations and
            address brokers, and from public sources such as public registers or the internet (websites, social media, etc.). We may also collect master data from our shareholders
            and investors. We generally keep master data for 10 years from the last exchange between us or from the end of the contract. This period may be longer if required for
            evidentiary purposes, to comply with legal or contractual requirements, or for technical reasons. For contacts used only for marketing and advertising, the retention
            period is usually much shorter, usually no more than 2 years from the last contact.</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Contract data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means data that is collected in relation to the conclusion or performance of a contract, for example information about the contracts and the services provided or
            to be provided, as well as data from the period leading up to the conclusion of a contract, information required or used for performing a contract, and information
            about feedback (for example complaints, feedback about satisfaction, etc.). We generally collect this data from you, from contractual partners and from third parties
            involved in the performance of the contract, but also from third-party sources (for example credit information providers) and from public sources. We generally keep
            this data for 10 years from the last contract activity or from the end of the contract. This period may be longer where necessary for evidentiary purposes, to comply
            with legal or contractual requirements, or for technical reasons.</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Behavioral and preference data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Depending on our relationship with you, we try to get to know you better and to tailor our products, services and offers to you. For this purpose, we collect and
            process data about your behavior and preferences. We do so by evaluating information about your behavior in our domain, and we may also supplement this information with
            third-party information, including from public sources. Based on this data, we can for example determine the likelihood that you will use certain services or behave in
            a certain way. The data processed for this purpose is already known to us (for example where and when you use our services), or we collect it by recording your behavior
            (for example how you navigate our website). We anonymize or delete this data when it is no longer relevant for the purposes pursued, which may be - depending on the
            nature of the data - 24 months (for product and service preferences). This period may be longer where necessary for evidentiary purposes, to comply with legal or
            contractual requirements, or for technical reasons. We describe how tracking works on our website in Section 12 .</p>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Other data:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also collect data from you in other situations. For example, data that may relate to you (such as files, evidence, etc.) is processed in relation to administrative
            or judicial proceedings. We may also collect data for health protection (for example as part of health protection concepts). We may obtain or create photos, videos and
            sound recordings in which you may be identifiable (for example at events, with security cameras, etc.). We may also collect data about who enters certain buildings, and
            when or who has access rights (including in relation to access controls, based on registration data or lists of visitors, etc.), who participates in events or campaigns
            (for example competitions) and who uses our infrastructure and systems and when. Moreover, we collect and process data about our shareholders and other investors, in
            addition to master data, including information for registers, in relation to the exercise of their rights and events (for example general meetings). The retention
            period for this data depends on the processing purpose and is limited to what is necessary. This ranges from a few days for many security cameras, to a few weeks for
            contact tracing and visitor data, which is usually kept for 3 months, to several years or more for reports about events with images. Data relating to you as a
            shareholder or investor is kept in accordance with corporate law, but in any case for as long as you are invested.</p>
          <p>Much of the data set out in this Section 3 is provided to us by you (through forms, when you communicate with us, in relation to contracts, when you use the website,
            etc.). You are not obliged or required to disclose data to us except in certain cases, for example within the framework of binding health protection concepts (legal
            obligations). If you wish to enter into contracts with us or use our services, you must also provide us with certain data, in particular master data, contract data and
            registration data, as part of your contractual obligation under the relevant contract. When using our website, the processing of technical data cannot be avoided. If
            you wish to gain access to certain systems or buildings, you must also provide us with registration data. However, in the case of behavioral and preference data, you
            generally have the option of objecting or not giving consent.</p>
          <p>As far as it is not unlawful we also collect data from public sources (for example debt collection registers, land registers, commercial registers, the media, or the
            internet including social media) or receive data from public authorities and from other third parties (such as credit agencies, address brokers, associations,
            contractual partners, internet analytics services, etc.).</p>

            <li><h3 id="h.4i7ojhp"><span>For what purposes do we process your data? </span></h3></li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>We process your data for the purposes explained below. Further information is set out in Sections 12 and 13 for online services. These purposes and their objectives represent interests of us and potentially of third parties. You can find further information on the legal basis of our processing in Section 5.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>We process your data for purposes related to </span><b>communication </b><span>with you, in particular in relation to responding to </span><b>inquiries </b><span>and the </span><b>exercise
            of your rights </b><span>(Section 11) and to enable us to </span><b>contact </b><span>you in case of queries. For this purpose, we use in particular communication data and master data, and registration data in relation to offers and services that you use. We keep this data to document our communication with you, for training purposes, for quality assurance and for follow-up inquiries.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We process data for the conclusion, administration and performance of </span><b>contractual relationships</b><span>. </span></p>
          <p><span>We process data for </span><b>marketing purposes </b><span>and </span><b>relationship management</b><span>, for example to send our customers and other contractual partners personalized advertising for products and services from us and from third parties (for example from advertising partners). This may happen in the form of newsletters and other regular contacts (electronically, by e-mail or by telephone), through other channels for which we have contact information from you, but also as part of marketing campaigns (for example events, contests, etc.) and may also include free services (for example invitations, vouchers, etc.). You can object to such contacts at any time (see at the end of this Section 4) or refuse or withdraw consent to be contacted for marketing purposes. With your consent, we can target our online advertising on the internet more specifically to you (see Section 12). Finally, we also wish to enable our contractual partners to contact our customers and other contractual partners for marketing purposes (see Section 7).</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We further process your data for </span><b>market research</b><span>, to </span><b>improve our services and operations</b><span>, and for </span><b>product
            development</b><span>. In this context, we do not use any personal identifier, but only anonymous information or pseudonymous information without linking it to you.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We may also process your data for </span><b>security </b><span>and </span><b>access control purposes. </b></p>
          <p><span>We process personal data to </span><b>comply with laws, directives and recommendations from authorities and internal regulations </b><span><b>(«Compliance»)</b></span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We also process data for the purposes of our </span><b>risk management </b><span>and as part of our </span><b>corporate governance</b><span>, including business organization and development. </span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We may process your data for </span><b>further
            purposes</b><span>, for example as part of our internal processes and administration</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>or for quality assurance purposes and trainings. </span>
          </p>
          <ol start="5">
            <li><h3><span>On what basis do we process your data? </span></h3></li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>Where we ask for your </span><b>consent </b><span>for</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>certain processing activities (for example for the processing of sensitive personal data, for marketing mailings, for personalized </span><span>motion</span><span>&nbsp;profiles and for advertising management and behavior analysis on the website), we will inform you separately about the relevant processing purposes. You may withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future by providing us written notice (by mail) or, unless otherwise noted or agreed, by sending an e-mail to us; see our contact details in Section 2. For withdrawing consent for online tracking, see Section 12. Where you have a user account, you may also withdraw consent or contact us also through the relevant website or other service, as applicable. Once we have received notification of withdrawal of consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) you consented to, unless we have another legal basis to do so. Withdrawal of consent does not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent prior to withdrawal.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>Where we do not ask for consent for processing, the processing of your personal data relies on the requirement of the processing for </span><b>initiating or
            performing a contract </b><span>with you (or the entity you represent) or on our or a third-party </span><b>legitimate interest </b><span>in the particular processing, in particular in pursuing the purposes and objectives set out in Section 4 and in implementing related measures. Our legitimate interests also include compliance with </span><b>legal
            regulations</b><span>, insofar as this is not already recognized as a legal basis by applicable data protection law (for example in the case of the GDPR, the laws in the EEA and in the case of the DPA, Swiss law). This also includes the marketing of our products and services, the interest in better understanding our markets and in managing and further developing our company, including its operations, safely and efficiently.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>Where we receive sensitive personal data (for example health data, data about political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, and biometric data for identification purposes), we may process your data on other legal basis, for example, in the event of a dispute, as required in relation to a potential litigation or for the enforcement or defense of </span><b>legal
            claims</b><span>. In some cases, other legal basis may apply, which we will communicate to you separately as necessary.</span></p>
          <ol start="6">
            <li><h3><span>What applies in case of profiling and automated individual decisions? </span></h3></li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>We may automatically evaluate personal aspects relating to you («</span><b>profiling</b><span>») based on your data (Section 3) for the purposes set out in Section 4, where we wish to determine preference data, but also in order to detect misuse and security risks, to perform statistical analysis or for operational planning. We may also create profiles for these purposes, i.e. we may combine behavioral and preference data, but also master data, contract data and technical data relating to you in order to better understand you as a person with your various interests and other characteristics. We may also create anonymous and – with your consent – personalized motion profiles of you.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>In both cases, we pay attention to the proportionality and reliability of the results and take measures against misuse of these profiles or profiling. Where these can produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, we generally ensure human review.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>In certain situations, it may be necessary for the efficiency and consistency of decision-making processes that we automate discretionary decisions that produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you («</span><b>automated
            individual decisions</b><span>»). In these cases, we will inform you accordingly and take the measures required by applicable law.</span></p>

          <p><span>In relation to our contracts, the website, our services and products, our legal obligations or otherwise with protecting our legitimate interests and the other purposes set out in Section 4, we may disclose your personal data to third parties, in particular to the following categories of recipients:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Service providers:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>We work with service providers in Switzerland and abroad who process your data on our behalf or as joint controllers with us or who receive data about you from us as separate controllers (for example IT providers, shipping companies, advertising service providers, login service providers, cleaning companies, security companies, banks, insurance companies, debt collection companies, credit information agencies, or address verification providers). For the service providers used for the website, see Section 12.</span>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Contractual partners including customers:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>This refers to customers (for example service recipients) and our other contractual partners as this data disclosure results from these contracts. For example, they receive registration data in relation to issued and redeemed vouchers, invitations, etc. If you work for one of these contractual partners, we may also disclose data about you to that partner in this regard. These recipients also include contractual partners with whom we cooperate or who carry out advertising for us and to whom we may therefore disclose data about you for analysis and marketing purposes (these may again be service recipients, but also sponsors and online advertising providers). We require these partners to send you or display advertising based on your data only with your consent (for online advertising, see Section 12). Our online advertising partners are listed in Section 12.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span></span></p>

            <li><b>Authorities:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>We may disclose personal data to agencies, courts and other authorities in Switzerland and abroad if we are legally obliged or entitled to make such disclosures or if it appears necessary to protect our interests. These authorities act as separate controllers.</span>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Group Companies:</b></li>

            <li><b>Other persons:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>This means other cases where interactions with third parties follows from the purposes set out in Section 4, for example service recipients, the media and associations in which we participate or if you are included in one of our publications.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>All these categories of recipients may involve third parties, so that your data may also be disclosed to them. We can restrict the processing by certain third parties (for example IT providers), but not by others (for example authorities, banks, etc.).</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We reserve the right to make such disclosures even of </span><b>secret data </b><span>(unless we have expressly agreed with you that we will not disclose such data to certain third parties, except if we are required to do so by law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, your data will continue to be subject to adequate data protection in Switzerland and the rest of Europe, even after disclosure. For disclosure to other countries, the provisions of Section 8 apply. If you do not wish certain data to be disclosed, please let us know so that we can review if and to what extent we can accommodate your concern (Section 2).</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>In addition, we enable </span><b>certain third parties </b><span>to collect </span><b>personal data from you </b><span>on our website and at events organized by us (for example press photographers, providers of tools on our website, etc.). Where we have no control over these data collections, these third parties are sole controllers. If you have concerns or wish to exercise your data protection rights, please contact these third parties directly. See Section 12 for the website.</span>

          <p><span>If a recipient is located in a country without adequate statutory data protection, we require the recipient to undertake to comply with data protection (for this purpose, we use the revised European Commission’s standard contractual clauses, which can be accessed here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?), </span><span>unless the recipient is subject to a legally accepted set of rules to ensure data protection and unless we cannot rely on an exception.

            <li><h3><span>Do we use online tracking and online advertising techniques? </span></h3></li>
          </ol>
          <p><span>We use various techniques on our website that allow us and third parties engaged by us to recognize you during your use of our website, and possibly to track you across several visits. This Section informs you about this.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>In essence, we wish to distinguish access by you (through your system) from access by other users, so that we can ensure the functionality of the website and carry out analysis and personalization. We do not intend to determine your identity, even if that is possible where we or third parties engaged by us can identify you by combination with registration data. &nbsp;However, even without registration data, the technologies we use are designed in such a way that you are recognized as an individual visitor each time you access the website, for example by our server (or third-party servers) that assign a specific identification number to you or your browser (so-called «cookie»).</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We use these technologies on our website and may allow certain third parties to do so as well. However, depending on the purpose of these technologies, we may ask for consent before they are used. </span><span>You can also set your browser to block or deceive certain types of cookies or alternative technologies, or to delete existing cookies. You can also add software to your browser that blocks certain third-party tracking. You can find more information on the help pages of your browser (usually with the keyword «Privacy») or on the websites of the third parties set out below.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We distinguish the following categories of «cookies» (including other technologies such as fingerprinting):</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Essential cookies:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some cookies are necessary for the functioning of the website or for certain features. For example, they ensure that you can move between pages without losing
            information that was entered in a form. They also ensure that you stay logged in. These cookies exist temporarily only («session cookies»). If you block them, the
            website may not work properly. Other cookies are necessary for the server to store options or information (which you have entered) beyond a session (i.e. a visit to the
            website) if you use this function (for example language settings, consents, automatic login functionality, etc.). These cookies have an expiration date of up to 24
            months (more details can be found in the Cookie Consent Banner).</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Functional cookies:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In order to optimize our website and related offers and to better adapt them to the needs of the users, we use cookies to record and analyze the use of our website,
            potentially beyond one session. We use third-party analytics services for this purpose. We have listed them below. Before we use such cookies, we ask for your consent.
            Performance cookies also have an expiration date of up to 24 months. Further details as to the processing can be found on the websites of the third-party providers (see
            also Cookie Consent Banner).</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Marketing Cookies:</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>We and our advertising partners have an interest in targeting advertising as precisely as possible, i.e. only showing it to those we wish to address. We have listed our advertising partners below. For this purpose, we and our advertising partners – if you consent – use cookies that can record the content that has been accessed or the contracts that have been concluded. This allows us and our advertising partners to display advertisements that we think will interest you on our website, but also on other websites that display advertisements from us or our advertising partners. These cookies have an expiration period of a few days to 12</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>months, depending on the circumstances. If you consent to the use of these cookies, you will be shown related advertisements. If you do not consent to them, you will not see less advertisements, but simply any other advertisement.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>In addition to marketing cookies, we use other technologies to control online advertising on other websites and thereby reduce advertising wastage. For example, we may transmit the e-mail addresses of our users, customers and other persons to whom we wish to display advertisements to operators of advertising platforms (for example social media). If these persons are registered with them with the same e-mail address (which the advertising platforms determine by a matching process), the providers display our advertisements specifically to these persons. The providers do not receive personal e-mail addresses of persons who are not already known to them. In case of known e-mail addresses, however, they learn that these persons are in contact with us and the content they have accessed.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We may also integrate additional third-party offers on our website, in particular from social media providers. These offers are deactivated by default. As soon as you activate them (for example by clicking a button), these providers can determine that you are using our website. If you have an account with that social media provider, it can assign this information to you and thereby track your use of online offers. These social media providers process this data as separate controllers.</span>
          </p>
          <p>More details can be found in the Cookie Consent Banner.</p>
          <div><span>We currently use offers from the following service providers and advertising partners (where they use data from you or cookies set on your computer for advertising purposes):</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Tag Manager</li>
              <li>Google Optimize</li>
              <li>DoubleClick Ad</li>

          <p><span>We publish our own newsletters in order to provide up-to-date information about our products and services, as well as a newsletter on crypto tax news to which anyone could opt-in. We send the product newsletter after a user creates an account on the website or registers with an email via the mobile app.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>We use the provider Customer.io </span><span>to send out our product and crypto tax newsletters. </span></p>

          <p><span>Customer.io is provided by the Peaberry Software Inc. at 9450 SW Gemini Dr., Suite 43920, Beaverton, Oregon 97008-7105 The data required to provide you with the newsletter that was stored during the website registration process will be transmitted to Peaberry Software Inc. Customer.io servers located in the European Union, where it will be stored in compliance with GDPR regulations.. The data entered during registration will not be transferred to other third parties. Furthermore, Customer.io offers various ways to analyze how the newsletter is opened and used once it is sent, e.g. how many users an email will be sent to, whether emails failed to deliver and whether users unsubscribed from the list after receiving an email. However, these analyses are performed in bulk, and are used for statistical analyses only, and no individual analyses are provided.

          <p><span></span></p>
          <p><span>The data processing for sending the newsletter is based on your consent. The analytics is based on our legitimate interest in reducing costs by deleting users which do not view our newsletters and ensuring the content of our newsletters are relevant to the recipients thus reducing the amount of unwanted content.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span>If you purchase goods or services from us, we may in future send you information E-Mails for similar goods or services.
